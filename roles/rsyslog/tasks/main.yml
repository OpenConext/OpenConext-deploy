    # For some reason, sometimes the link exists, sometimes /dev/log is a socket, sometimes /dev/log is missing
    # Rsyslog creates and deletes the /dev/log socket depending on imuxsock settings, journald wants to create the symlink
    # and sometimes they get in each others way
    # option syssock.name =  /run/systemd/journal/dev-log results in a missing /dev/log and although logging seems
    # to keep working, the logger command complains
    # Creating the link if it is not there seems to be the best option
