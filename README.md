Ansible-driven provisioning of the OpenConext platform.
==============================

# Getting started

These steps for setting up are based on Mac OS X and the Open Source [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.
While it is possible to deploy OpenConext using other environments, currently it is unsupported.

## Install Vagrant and VirtualBox

VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product, downloads and user manual can be found on the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
> Vagrant provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.

For installation instructions see [the website](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html).

You will need at least Vagrant 1.7

To install both with Homebrew:

    brew tap caskroom/cask
    brew install brew-cask
    brew cask install vagrant
    brew cask install virtualbox

With the above commands you get the latest versions. There might be incompatibilities. Vagrant will tell you and if you need a different version install cask versions and install the correct version of virtualbox and / or vagrant:

    brew tap caskroom/versions
    brew cask install virtualbox4330101610

## Install Ansible

Ansible is the configuration tool we use to describe our servers.
Installation instruction can be found on the [Ansible website](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html).
The minimum required version of Ansible is 1.8.
To install for development with Homebrew:

    brew install python
    pip install --upgrade setuptools
    pip install --upgrade pip
    brew linkapps
    brew install ansible

## Run playbooks

The VM will install everything on a two boxes for demo purposes.

To provision the VM please run:

```bash
./provision-vagrant
```

When the script is done, wait a little while to let all services come up and initialize themselves. Then point your browser to [https://vm.openconext.org](https://vm.openconext.org)

These are the steps the above script performs:

1. Setup a Vagrant VM and will make sure the HOSTS file is able to handle the defined base_domain
2. Setup a MySQL server and LDAP for storage.
3. Inserts entities and metadata in Janus and initial load of engineblock to bootstrap.
4. Install all Java apps for the openconext platform.
5. Install all PHP apps for the openconext platform.
6. Install Haproxy and Nginx for loadbalacing and SSL termination
7. Install [mujina](https://github.com/OpenConext/Mujina) as IDP and SP for the VM environment.

## Add hostname entries to your own /etc/hosts file

We need pseudo-DNS entries so that your browser can reach the VM-platform we just installed. So, add this very long line to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
192.168.66.78  vm.openconext.org serviceregistry.vm.openconext.org api.vm.openconext.org static.vm.openconext.org db.vm.openconext.org ldap.vm.openconext.org engine.vm.openconext.org  profile.vm.openconext.org apis.vm.openconext.org mujina-sp.vm.openconext.org mujina-idp.vm.openconext.org teams.vm.openconext.org manage.vm.openconext.org grouper.vm.openconext.org authz.vm.openconext.org voot.vm.openconext.org authz-admin.vm.openconext.org authz-playground.vm.openconext.org pdp.vm.openconext.org
```

Here, the ip-address `192.168.66.78` refers to the address that is mentioned in ./Vagrantfile.

## Enjoy your new VM!

Go to [https://vm.openconext.org](https://vm.openconext.org). To ssh to the machines use the following:

```
vagrant ssh lb
vagrant ssh apps
```

The lb vm contains haproxy and nginx. The apps vm contains all the applications, apache, database and ldap.

# Releases to vm, test, acc, prod

To update single applications - e.g. release - use:

```
./provision-single-component ${vm|test|acc|prod} ${remote-user} ${absolute location of secrets file} ${component}
```

The secrets used by Ansible are externalized. For the VM the secrets are in this github repp, for test in an internal SURF repo on the build server and for acc and prod the secrets are managed by Prolocation.

# VM

To provision the VM use the following (password is vagrant and sudo password is <enter>

```
ansible-playbook -u vagrant -i inventory/vm -K selfservice.yml -k
```

# Development

Setting up a development environment is described in the file [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md).
